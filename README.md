# ECG-Classification

The project is about to classify Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 

Dataset consist of 4 different signal types of patients; normal patients, Atrial fibrillation patients, noisy signals and others. 

Time sequenced signals are converted into image spectrograms to convert the problem into an image classification. 

I designed an CNN model and trained the model with the images.
